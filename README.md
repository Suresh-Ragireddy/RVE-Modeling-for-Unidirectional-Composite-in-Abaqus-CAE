# RVE Modeling for Unidirectional Composite in Abaqus CAE

## Overview

This repository presents the results of the project "RVE Modeling for Unidirectional Composite in Abaqus CAE". We focused on creating Representative Volume Element (RVE) models with a 65% fiber volume fraction to assess the mechanical properties of unidirectional composites. The simulations investigate different fiber arrangements: uniform, zigzag, and random, within the RVE.

## Models

In this project, the following RVE models were developed to study the mechanical behavior of the composites:

- **Single Fiber Model**: Examines the influence of a single fiber embedded in the matrix.
- **9 Fibers Uniform Model**: Represents a uniform distribution of fibers, arranged to simulate a regular composite material.
- **Zig Zag Model**: Introduces a zigzag fiber pattern to evaluate the impact of an alternative fiber arrangement.
- **Random Model**: Depicts fibers distributed randomly within the RVE, providing insights into the composite material with a non-uniform fiber distribution.

## Meshing

A consistent meshing approach was applied to all models to ensure uniformity in simulation results.

## Boundary Conditions

Simulations were carried out under the following boundary conditions:
- **Normal Boundary Condition**: Applicated stresses along the XX, YY, and ZZ axes.
- **Shear Boundary Condition**: Shear stresses evaluated on the XY, XZ, and YZ planes.

These conditions are pivotal for analyzing the composite material's response under various load scenarios.
